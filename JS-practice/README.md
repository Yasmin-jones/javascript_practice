function in JavaScript
As you become familiar with JavaScript, you will see the function keyword used in ways that appear roughly equivalent to concepts in Ruby.

While it's convenient to use these analogies, they can lead to an inaccurate picture of how JavaScript really works. As a language, JavaScript is fundamentally different to Ruby and understanding these differences will make you a better programmer.

The function keyword in JavaScript creates an object that can be called. (We say call in JavaScript, but that will make for confusing reading since 'call' has lots of meanings in English; let's use invoke instead).

In Ruby, we invoke (call) methods, not objects (a method belongs to an object). But imagine that's just semantics. Can you visualise a method as being just another object? Perhaps it would help to think of it as an instance of a Method class or something similar? Don't worry if you're only vaguely grasping this; you're already ahead of many JavaScript hobbyists!

The anatomy of function
We've become familiar in Ruby with literals. These are expressions that directly create a new object whenever they are evaluated:

"Ben"  # creates a new String object
[]  # creates a new Array object
{}  # creates a new Hash object
The function keyword in JavaScript creates a new Function object (i.e. an object that can be invoked):

const bark = function() {
  return 'Woof';
}

bark();  //invoking the function will return 'Woof'

// ES6
let miaow = () => 'miaow'; // equivalent to `let miaow = () => { return 'Miaow' }`; ommitting the {} allows for an implicit return

miaow()
You must include the parentheses when invoking a function, even if there are no arguments. Can you reason why? What is bark; on its own with no parentheses?

You can declare arguments in functions, as you would expect:

const bark = function(name) {
  return name + ' says Woof';
}

bark('Barney');  //will return 'Barney says Woof'

// ES6
let miaow = (name) => {
  return `${name} says miaow`;
}

miaow('Ed') // "Ed says Miaow"
If you want to return a value from a JavaScript function, you must explicitly use return, otherwise it will just return undefined.

function is like a block
In Ruby, we can pass a block to another method like so:

['one', 'two', 'three'].each do |number|
  puts number
end
In JavaScript, we can do a very similar thing by passing an anonymous function.

An anonymous function is a function without a name.

['one', 'two', 'three'].forEach(function(number) {
  console.log(number);
});

// ES6
['one', 'two', 'three'].forEach(number => console.log(number)) // the parentheses for the anonymous arrow function argument are not needed. Note how much more readable this is!
But don't allow the syntax to confuse you; what are we actually passing to the forEach function? It's just a Function object. The following is exactly the same:

const callback = function(arg) {
  console.log(arg);
};

// ES6
let callback = (arg) => console.log(arg);

['one', 'two', 'three'].forEach(callback);  
It's common to refer to this use of a function as a callback.

Summary
It takes a while to understand JavaScript and the worst way to start is to try to force your understanding of Ruby onto it. Once you are comfortable with the idea that a function is an object that can be invoked; and there are different ways to invoke a function, you are well on your way.
